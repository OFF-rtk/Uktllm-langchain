## 🚗 Logistics, Traffic & Parking (Critical)
* **Mall Road Rules:**
    * **Entry Prohibited:** Unlike Nainital, Almora's main bazaar is largely pedestrian-only or restricted for heavy vehicles during the day (8 AM - 8 PM).
* **Parking Situation:** Extremely difficult on the main ridge.
* **Official Parking Spots:**
    1.  **Multi-Level Parking (Mall Road):** Near the bus stand.
    2.  **Akashvani/Radio Station Parking:** On the outskirts; safer for long-term parking.
* **Traffic Note:** The town is built on a "Horse Saddle" ridge. Most internal roads are one-way loops. Missing a turn can mean a 3km detour.

## ♿ Accessibility & Facilities
* **Wheelchair Access:** Poor. The town is full of stairs and steep cobbled paths (especially Lala Bazar).
* **Network Connectivity:** Excellent 4G/5G in town and Kasar Devi.
* **ATMs:** Plenty on Mall Road (SBI, PNB, BoB).
* **Restrooms:** Available at the Bus Stand and near Golu Devta Temple.

## ⭐ "The Vibe" & Tourist Sentiment (Curated)
* **The Vibe:** Intellectual, slow-paced, and spiritual. Not a "party" hill station.
* **Best For:** Writers, artists, spiritual seekers, and history buffs.
* **Common Complaint:** "The city is congested and finding parking is a nightmare."
* **Local Tip:** "Stay in **Kasar Devi** (Crank's Ridge) if you want peace and views. Stay in **Almora Town** only if you want heritage and markets."
