## 🚗 Logistics, Traffic & Parking (Critical)
* **Terrain Warning:** Kausani is not a "town" but a "ridge." The main road is the only road. It is narrow and steep.
* **Parking Situation:** **Critical.** Almost no public parking exists on the ridge.
* **Advice:** Ensure your hotel has dedicated parking. Do not park on the roadside as it blocks buses connecting Garhwal and Kumaon.
* **Fuel:** The nearest reliable petrol pump is at Garur (15 km away) or Someshwar (12 km away). Keep tank full.

## ♿ Accessibility & Facilities
* **Wheelchair Access:** Moderate. The Anashakti Ashram has a ramp, but the steep incline to reach it is difficult. Tea gardens are not wheelchair accessible.
* **Network Connectivity:** Good 4G (Jio/Airtel) in the main hotel area. Weakens near Rudradhari Falls.
* **ATMs:** SBI ATM available near the market, but often runs out of cash. Carry cash from Almora/Kathgodam.

## ⭐ "The Vibe" & Tourist Sentiment (Curated)
* **The Vibe:** Silent, panoramic, and romantic. It is a place to "do nothing" but watch the peaks change color at sunrise.
* **Best For:** Honeymooners, elderly couples, and writers.
* **Common Complaint:** "There is nothing to 'do' after sunset. No market, no nightlife."
* **Local Tip:** "Wake up at 5:00 AM. The sunrise turns the snow peaks gold. If you miss this, you missed Kausani."
